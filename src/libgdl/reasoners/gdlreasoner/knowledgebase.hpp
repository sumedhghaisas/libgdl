/**
 * This class represents knowledge base which stores information and performs
 * reasoning. This implementation of Knowledge base performs back chaining for
 * answer extraction. KnowledgeBase can be initialized with KIF object.
 * The knowledge is stored in map so that the lookup is faster. The logic
 * part is handles by the class Unify.
 * Sample usage -
 *
 * @code
 * KIF kif;
 * kif.AddFile("3puzzle.kif");
 * kif.Parse();
 * KnowledgeBase kb(kif);
 * list<Argument*> result = kb.Ask(Argument("(role ?x)"));
 * @endcode
 *
 * Result will contain all the roles of 3puzzle.
 *
 * @see KIF, Unify
